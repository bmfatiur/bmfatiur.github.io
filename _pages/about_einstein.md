Hello! I'm a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from Pabna University of Science and Technology, Bangladesh, Class of 2025. From the very beginning of my academic journey, I have been deeply passionate about computer vision, marveling at its potential to revolutionize technology and everyday life. Currently, I am preparing to pursue higher studies abroad while actively engaging in research that contributes to this transformative field.

My expertise is rooted in the dynamic field of computer vision, where I focus on developing intelligent systems that address complex challenges and enhance lives. While this remains my primary focus, I am equally intrigued by related domains such as autonomous vehicles, pattern and activity recognition, 3D vision, robotics, and human-computer interactionâ€”areas where innovation meets real-world impact.

Beyond academia and research, I thrive on leadership and community initiatives, as they offer invaluable opportunities to grow and create positive change.
